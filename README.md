# Spring Scaffy

Scaffy is a simple library that helps you create applications based on the spring framework. Scaffy uses code templates to create services and / or controllers on your behalf. Scaffy mostly weaves spring annotations at the code templates of your choice. The types of annotations scaffy weaves include types for: 
- Http Request Mapping. 
- Transaction Management. 
- Caching 
- Security (OAuth2). 

## Reusable Code Templates  
Scaffy's objective is to provide code templates for traditional services you usually have to code in modern web applications like:
- Code templates based on spring's lovely rest controller to create Restful CRUD / Multipart web services.
- Code templates based on spring for web socket programming.
- Code templates based on spring data (For example: JPA, Mongo and Cassandra).
- Code templates for Asynchronous programming (based on libraries like disruptor or reactive java).
- Code templates for integration (JMS 2.0).
